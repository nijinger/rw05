                 Installing RadWare with the gf3m add-on
                          M. A. Caprio, 7/8/04

Step 1.  Create the Radware source directory

    The Radware files are available from http://radware.phy.ornl.gov.
    The gf3m add-on has been compiled with RadWare 00 and RadWare
    01 and might possibly work with subsequent versions as well.

    Create a directory /usr/local/rw01 containing the RadWare
    distribution files as follows.  (If you do not have root privileges,
    you can carry out this procedure under your home directory instead.)

    cd /usr/local
    Copy the file rw01.1.0.tgz (or whatever version of Radaware you
    are using) to /usr/local.
    gunzip rw01.1.0.tgz
    tar xvf rw01.1.0.tar    [This creates a subdirectory named rw01.]

Step 2.  Add the gf3m files

    Copy the files gf3m_subs.c and Makefile.gf3m to the RadWare source
    file directory (/usr/local/rw01/src).

Step 3.  Edit various RadWare settings for your installation (see the
RadWare documentation for further help)

    cd /usr/local/rw01/src

    cp Makefile.linux Makefile    [or "cp Makefile.solaris Makefile", or as appropriate]
   
    Open the file Makefile in a text editor.

    Change the lines starting with the words INSTALL_DIR, INSTALL, and
    INSTALL_BIN to read as follows (you can choose a different
    installation directory name if you wish):

      INSTALL_DIR = /usr/local/rw01
          INSTALL = /usr/sbin/install -m 0644
      INSTALL_BIN = /usr/sbin/install -m 0755

    Unless you are using the special Oak Ridge HIS libraries, delete
    the line labeled HISLIBS in the Makefile if it is present.

    On Linux systems without GNU readline installed, delete
    "-DHAVE_GNU_READLINE" from the line labeled CFLAGS in the
    Makefile, and delete "-lreadline -lncurses" from the line labeled
    LIBS in the Makefile.  

    If your computer has an unusual X Windows installation, you may
    also need to edit the lines starting with the words X_WIN_TOP and
    MOTIF_TOP to contain the names of the directories where the
    X-Windows libraries are installed on your computer.  You must find
    where these directories are on your computer.

    Open the file .radwarerc in a text editor and change the second
    through fourth lines to read as follows (or as appropriate if you
    chose an installation directory other than /usr/local/rw01 above):

    setenv RADWARE_FONT_LOC     /usr/local/rw01/font
    setenv RADWARE_ICC_LOC      /usr/local/rw01/icc
    setenv RADWARE_GFONLINE_LOC /usr/local/rw01/doc
   
Step 3.  Compile the RadWare programs and gf3m

  If you want a complete RadWare installation (optional):

    make all
        Even if this crashes, you might still be able to make gf3m (below).
    make install
        This may crash at a late stage in the installation, which is fine...
    make install-bin
    make very-clean

  For gf3m:

    make -f Makefile.gf3m

    This will create an executable file named gf3m.  Copy it to somewhere 
    in your command path, e.g., "/usr/local/rw01/bin" or "/usr/local/bin".
   
Step 4.  Modifying users' initialization files

  Each user who uses the csh or tcsh shell should modify his/her
  .cshrc file as follows (assuming RadWare was installed to
  /usr/local/rw01):

   1. Add the line "source /usr/local/rw01/.radwarerc".

   2. Put "/usr/local/rw01/bin" into the file search path.

--------------------

Suggestion for convenient display under Unix/Linux

  If you would like gf3m to appear in its own separate terminal window
  when you run it, put one of the following commands in a script file
  (or a csh alias) and use that script file to start gf3m.  Which
  command you use depends upon whether you have dtterm, kvt, or xterm
  installed on your system.  These commands may need modification to
  work properly on different systems.

  dtterm -geometry 132x13+1+1 -name "gf3m: $cwd" -e gf3m >& /dev/null &
  kvt -geometry 1000x220+1+1 -no_menubar -vt_size large -caption "gf3m: $cwd" -e gf3m >& /dev/null &
  xterm -geometry 132x13+1+1 -name "gf3m: $cwd" -e gf3m >& /dev/null &
