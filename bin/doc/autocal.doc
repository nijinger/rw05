Automatic Calibration Routines in gf3
=====================================

In the 1996 release of RadWare (rw96), a new function was added to
GF2, to automatically extract areas and centroids of peaks from Ge
detector source calibration spectra.  By the 1999 release (rw99 and
later), this feature had been expanded to allow the user a choice of
at least three different ways to do semi-automatic detector
calibrations.

(1) CA command; Autocalibrate Spectrum (1)
==========================================

The first such routine is run by the CA command (autoCAlibrate), or
Autocalibrate Spectrum (1) option in the info menu of xmgf3 or gf3x.

This routine uses a source data (.sou) file to define what peaks are
expected to be present in the spectrum.  It then automatically finds
the peaks, defines backgrounds and integrates to get centroids and
areas.  The results are stored in a Source INput (.sin) file, and
energy calibration fits may be optionally saved in an energy
calibration (.cal) file.  The command is intended to ease the
extraction of energy and efficiency calibrations, and to assist in
gain-matching detectors.  It operates on a single spectrum; energy
calibrations for many spectra in multi-spectrum files can be
automatically generated using CA3, see (3) below.

To use the command, read in the spectrum you want to analyze and type
CA.  You will be prompted for the name of a .sou source data file; you
can use the standard .sou files that come with radware, although it is
usually necessary to edit those for more complex sources (e.g. 152Eu,
133Ba) to remove some doublets etc.  An example of such an edited file
for 152Eu is given as demo/eu_autocal.sou.

The program will then find several peaks, work out the energy
dispersion and attempt to integrate over all the peaks listed in the
.sou file.  The results will be displayed on the graphics window, and
you will be requested to press <return> to proceed.  Next a plot of
the centroids, less the value expected if the spectrum was perfectly
linear in energy, will be displayed on an expanded scale.  Linear and
quadratic fits will be performed to the results of the peak
integration, and displayed on this plot; you will be given the
opportunity to save the results in an energy calibration file with the
same filename as the spectrum but with the filename extension changed
to .aca.

The program also automatically saves the results of the peak
integration in a standard radware-type .sin file, again with the same
filename as the spectrum but with the filename extension changed to
.sin.  This file may be used to input the data to the programs effit
and encal, or to deduce gain-correction coefficients for gain-matching
different detectors.

If the command seems to have trouble finding the peaks, or integrating
over what you gauge to be the correct region, try playing with the
PeakFind (PF) parameters.  It uses the FWHM parameter from PF to guess
at the width of the region of the spectrum that it should inspect for
peaks.  If you have strong contaminant peaks at high energies in your
spectrum, that could also confuse the peak-matching routine; you could
add the contaminant to your .sou file or simply use SC to remove the
offending peak(s) from the spectrum.

(3) CA3 command; Autocalibrate Spectrum (3)
===========================================

The second auto-calibration routine is run by the CA3 command, or
Autocalibrate Spectrum (3) option in the info menu of xmgf3 or gf3x.

Unlike the first routine (1) above, this mode of calibration is for
energy calibrations only, and uses just a simple two-point
calibration.  That is, it uses the energies and centroids of only two
peaks to determine the energy dispersion and offset for each spectrum.
Its main advantage is one of speed and reliability for
multiple-spectrum files (such as .spk or .spn files); it is intended to
produce calibrations for many spectra simultaneously.

This routine uses a "peak limits and info" (.lim) file to define
ranges of spectra numbers to be processed, the energy and a range of
channels to search for each of two different peaks, and an approximate
FWHM for the peaks.  An example of such a .lim file is given as 
demo/demo.lim, and listed below:

* limits for co60 2-point calib at ~0.35 keV/ch hires, 2keV/ch lores
* splo sphi   eg1   chlo1 chhi1     eg2   chlo2 chhi2  approx.fwhm
    1,   4, 1173.24, 3000, 3300,  1332.51, 3350, 3900,    7
    9,  11, 1173.24,  500,  620,  1332.51,  620,  720,   15

Here spectra IDs 1 through 4 will be searched for gamma 1173.24 keV
over channels 3000 to 3300, and then for gamma 1332.51 keV over
channels 3350 to 3900, with a FWHM of around 7 chs.  Likewise spectra
IDs 9 through 11 will be searched for gamma 1173.24 keV over channels
500 to 620, and for gamma 1332.51 keV over channels 620 to 720, with a
FWHM of around 15 chs.  Any number of spectra, with different
resolutions and energy dispersions, can be treated this way in a
single .lim file.  Such .lim files must contain a minimum of one data
line, but there is no maximum line count.  Also, lines beginning with
an asterisk (*) are treated as comments.

To run the CA3 routine, open the multiple-spectrum file you wish to
process, by reading in at least one spectrum from it.  Then type CA3,
or select the appropriate menu item.  The program will proceed through
the peaks and through the .lim file data lines (spectrum ID ranges),
displaying the integrated peaks and calculating the energy calibration
coefficients for each spectrum.  The results will be stored in a
text-format output file with the filename extension .ca3, and
containing one line for each spectrum ID successfully processed.

An example of a .ca3 output file follows:

 * gf3 autocalibrate type-3 output,  01-Apr-99 15:54:05
 * SP       A          B         CENT1   FWHM1     CENT2   FWHM2
    1    -2.033    .25462615    486.266   1.63   5537.703   2.31
    2     -.182    .26025367    468.639   1.68   5410.848   2.21
    3    -2.612    .24683824    503.952   1.68   5714.766   2.26
    4     1.876    .25990814    461.343   1.90   5410.122   2.40
    5      .849    .24480446    494.003   1.61   5748.106   2.20
    6    -2.091    .24093580    514.138   1.49   5852.606   2.41
    7      .069    .24572888    495.318   1.52   5729.656   2.29
    8    -2.861    .23925383    520.968   1.55   5896.966   2.35

Here the columns correspond to spectrum ID, energy offset and
dispersion (in keV and keV/ch), and centroid (in chs) and FWHM (in
keV) for the two peaks.  This example was generated by processing
152Eu spectra.

(4) CA4 command; Autocalibrate Spectrum (4)
===========================================

A third type of auto-calibration routine is run by the CA4 command, or
Autocalibrate Spectrum (4) option in the info menu of xmgf3 or gf3x.
It is intended for an easy, simple two-point energy calibration of a
single spectrum, when the user knows the energies of at least two
peaks.

To run the CA4 routine, read in and display the spectrum spectrum,
then type CA4 or select the appropriate menu item.  You will be
prompted to select two peaks with the graphics cursor; to select a
peak, simply click on the spectrum within one FWHM of the centroid.
You will then be asked to provide the energies of the two peaks.  The
energy calibration is then deduced, and becomes the defined gf3
calibration.

In order to facilitate providing the energies of the two peaks, you
can create a file called calib.sou, either in the current working
directory or in your home directory.  Use the standard format for .sou
files (see the demo directory for examples) and place in the file any
gamma-ray lines that you wish to use for such calibrations.  If a
calib.sou file is found by the CA4 routine, the energies of the gammas
listed in it will be printed on the screen, together with one-letter
IDs for each energy.  You can then use that ID to specify the energy,
rather than typing the energy itself.

An example calib.sou is given in the demo directory.
