This is the source code of the Linux/Unix version of David Radford's Data
Analysis Software. This release is portable between Solaris, SunOS,
DEC Unix, Linux, SGI/Irix, HP, AIX, and Mac OS X.

A brief description of what each program does is in the file
doc/aa_radware.lis.  More documentation can also be found at
http://radware.phy.ornl.gov/
and in other files in the doc directory.
You can find demonstration data files in the demo directory.

To compile rw05, you should be able to use almost any C compiler.

==================================
== To download the source code: ==
==================================

By ftp:
=======

In your browser, go to
	ftp://radware.phy.ornl.gov/pub/radware/unix/

The file you want should be 
        current.tgz
which is linked to the latest version of rw05
(rw05.2.tgz at the time of writing this)

Save the file and move it to your home directory.
Then open a terminal and unpack the codes by typing
        cd
	tar xvzf current.tgz

By svn:
=======

An alternative to using ftp in your browser is to use Subversion
(svn).  If you have svn installed, you can use the command
	svn co https://radware.phy.ornl.gov/rw05
to check out the latest rw05 source tree.

=============================================
== Required Software Development Packages: ==
=============================================

Radware will be compiled from scratch. That means that you need to have
some "development packages" installed on your system, or the compile will
fail.

You will always wany to have readline and X11 installed. If you want to use
GUI versions of gls, escl8r, levit8r and 4dg8r, then you will also need
GTK2 and/or lesstif (or openmotif) packages installed.
See README.macosx for more details for Macs.

On my Kubuntu system, I need at least to install the following:
gcc   (C compiler)
make  (to build the programs)
libreadline-dev
libgtk2.0-dev
lesstif2-dev

==================
== To Compile:  ==
==================

There is a separate README files for Mac OS X, namely README.macosx.
If you are installing on a mac, read that file too.

1) Type:
	cd rw05/src
	cp Makefile.sys Makefile

   where "sys" is "aix", "dec", "hp-ux9.1", "irix", "linux", "solaris",
   "sunos", or "macosx".
   Edit the top level Makefile (the one you just made with the cp command).
   If needed, change any of the lines that depend specifically on your local
   filesystem, for example the definitions of X_WIN_TOP and MOTIF_TOP.
   Change INSTALL_DIR, INSTALL and INSTALL_BIN if you wish to install the
   files in a separate directory (see step 4).

2) RadWare can read spectra from ORNL-format .his histogram files.
   Most users will not be interested in this feature; if this includes you,
   skip to step 3.
   If you want to be able to read .his files, your system needs to have the
   ORPHLIB library installed, and you need to change your Makefile to link
   some of the programs with orphlib.a and some FORTRAN run-time libraries.
   Here is what you need to do:
     Edit your top level Makefile, and uncomment the line that defines HISLIBS,
        changing the FORTRAN libraries and the location of orphlib.a as needed.
	If (and only if) orphlib.a was compiled with g77, you also need to 
        uncomment the line redefining          FC = g77

3) Type:
	make all

   If your system is missing development libraries, such as X11 or
   readline, the make will fail. There will be compile errors, usually
   beginning with something like
     "error: readline/readline.h: No such file or directory"
   If this happens, speak to your system administrator, and/or try to
   find out whcih packages to install, and how to do it.
   See above for a list of packages required for Ubuntu.
   See README.macosx for packages required for Mac OS X.

   If your system does not have the GTK2 development libraries
   installed, the make will fail when it gets to the GTK versions of
   some of the programs, namely gtkgls, gtkesc, etc. If you don't want to
   use any GUI versions of these codes, the you can stop at this point.
   If you want to use Motif versions but not GTK versions, then edit
   Makefile.common and comment out (with #) the line:
      gtkgls gtkesc gtklev gtk4dg \

   If your system does not have the Motif development libraries
   installed, the make will fail when it gets to the Motif versions of
   some of the programs, namely xmgf3, xmgls etc. If you don't want to
   use Motif versions of the codes, then you can stop at this point.


4) You can install the executables and data files in a separate directory.
   This is not necessary to run the programs; if you choose not to do the
   install, you can just run them directly from the src directory of steps
   1) and 3).
 
   To install, check the definition of INSTALL_DIR, INSTALL and INSTALL_BIN
   in the Makefile and type:
	make install

   If the install fails for some reason, try editing your top level Makefile,
   to replace the line near the end:
        include Makefile.install_sysv
   or
        include Makefile.install_ucb
   by:
        include Makefile.install_cp
   and try again.

5) Edit the .radwarerc file so that the pathname variables
   are properly defined to $(INSTALL_DIR)/font, etc., or whatever.
   These definitions will allow the various programs to find files that
   they need, such as icc/icctbl.dat, font/font.dat, and doc/gfonline.hlp.
   There are some other environment variables in there, too, that you
   might like to play with.  See WHATS_NEW for details.

   .radwarerc can be found in either the src directory, or in $(INSTALL_DIR).
   There is also a bash version, .radware.bashrc, for those who prefer bash
   to tcsh or csh.

6) Make sure that your .login, .bashrc, or .cshrc, or the system .login, includes
	source $(INSTALL_DIR)/.radwarerc
   or copy the .radwarerc to your home directory and have it executed
   from there.
   Also make sure that $(INSTALL_DIR)/bin (or the src directory, if you 
   didn't do the install) is in your path.
   Then you are set to go; try gf3, gtkgls etc.
   Have a look in the demo directory for sample files.
   You should also copy demo/gfinit.dat into your home directory.

7) To clean up the source directory:
	make clean
   To clean up the source and all subdirectories, leaving only the source code:
	make very-clean

8) On the latest Ubuntu distributions, you may need to install the
   xfonts-75dpi or xfonts-100dpi package, and restart your X-server,
   before some codes will run.
