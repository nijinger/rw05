 gf3m -- gf3 spectrum analysis program, customized and matrix-enabled
 
    Modifications are by M. A. Caprio, WNSL/CTP, Yale University.
    Based upon gf3 version 0.0 from RadWare 99beta.2.12, by D. C. Radford, ORNL.
    Revision 8/3/04.

 Matrix gating
   matr filename - read matrix projections from matrix file
   projx, projy  - display x or y projection
   gatex, gatey  - perform background-subtracted gate on x or y projection
       Select gate region by clicking on leftmost and rightmost channels. If background
       subtraction is desired, select one or more background regions.  Right click when
       done.  Note: gatey is considerably faster than gatex due to the matrix file's
       internal structure.
   dim xdim ydim int_type swap_bytes [offset] - set dimensions for non-RadWare matrices
       Most matrix files can be read by setting these parameters appropriately:
       possibly unequal x and y dimensions up to 16384, 1/2/4-byte signed integers,
       byte order reversal for matrices created on different machine types (0=OFF, 1=ON).
       For a matrix which starts somewhere beyond the beginning of the file, e.g., after
       a header or other histograms, specify the offset of the matrix in bytes.
   rand 0|K singx singy - set up automatic time randoms subtraction using acceptance 
       constant K and singles spectra singx and singy, or 0 to disable

 Spectrum navigation
   ge E   - display region centered on energy E (width is set with ex command)
   gc ch  - display region centered on channel ch (width is set with ex command)
   <left arrow><enter>, <right arrow><enter> - move left or right one window-full
   ex [n] - if n specified, expand to n channels centered on current center (*)
   back   - go back to previous display limits, i.e., undo last expansion or move
       When ge or gc displays the energy or channel you request, it uses the
       width set by the most recent ex command.  Tip for effective use: Use ex
       once to set a convenient zoomed viewing width, e.g., 150 channels, and
       then use ge to jump to the peaks you are interested in.

 Spectrum display and analysis
   nf     - FWHM now expressed as energy, quadratic bkgd. suppressed by default (*)
   sy 0|1 - set "shared y-axis" mode
       All overlayed spectra are displayed with the same y-axis range.  The Y0 and
       NY commands make y-scale changes which are applied *immediately* to the
       the next redisplay.  For NY 0, the upper y-scale limit is chosen to
       accomodate all currently displayed spectra.

 Spectrum saving and output
   ra filename   - read all displayed spectra and display settings from a .gf3m file
   wa filename   - write all displayed spectra and display settings to a .gf3m file
   hc [filename] - if filename specified, PostScript output is written to file,
        otherwise interactive print occurs -- removes several prompts to user (*)
